.
Proposed Milestone:

Annual goal: 350,000 reshored jobs per year through 2027.

Cumulative: Reach 3 million jobs by end of 2028.

Why it matters: Sustained reshoring ensures strong domestic capacity and improved resilience.

Question 1: Does “jobs” work as your reshoring metric, or would you prefer counting major factory openings, total investment dollars, or something else?

🛡️ 2. Defense Tech Modernization
Current Status: DoD budget ~$1 trillion (FY2026), with R&D increasing (e.g., $20 billion for science, $1.3 billion to supply chain)

Proposed Milestone:

Deploy 10 new defense-tech contracts (AI/autonomous, quantum, hypersonics) valued at $1 billion+ each by 2026.

Grow S&T/R&D funding by +10 percent year-over-year through 2028.

Add 5 new industrial-scale defense facilities (e.g., munitions, chips, robotics) by 2027.

Question 2: Which output matters most to you—contract count, R&D budget, new facility builds, or deployment scale?

⚡ 3. Energy & Infrastructure
Current Status: Renewables ~17% of power (wind + solar), 9% of primary energy; renewables outpaced coal in generation

Proposed Milestone:

Achieve 30 percent renewables of electricity generation by 2027.

Build 50 GW additional solar + wind capacity by 2027 (≈ 38 GW solar, 12 GW wind).

Deploy 100 GW extra grid transmission capacity (per DOE corridor goals) by 2030.

Question 3: What focus should we set—renewable share, capacity added, or grid infrastructure upgrades?

🧰 4. Workforce Development
Current Status: Manufacturing apprenticeships rose 83% since 2010

Proposed Milestone:

Certify 200,000 new skilled-trade apprentices or candidates annually by 2026.

Launch 100 publicly recognized training centers by 2027.

75% job placement rate for apprentices within six months by 2025.

Question 4: Should we track certification numbers, training capacity, placement rates—or all three?

🧠 5. Tech‑Policy Alignment
Current Status: Bipartisan defense-tech AI funding is accelerating, but there's tension between security rules and innovation speed

Proposed Milestone:

Pass 3 major bipartisan bills (e.g., AI R&D, data policy, dual-use tech) by 2026.

Fast-track 2 national innovation pathways (like DIU) receiving funding by 2027.

Maintain <2-month average review time for dual-use tech export approvals by 2028.

Question 5: Which policy spaces matter most—AI, dual-use tech, export control, R&D funding—or should we track a combination?

🔗 6. Supply Chain Sovereignty
Current Status: Recent Biden admin set aside $1 billion for rare-earths, grid, battery minerals under IIJA

.
Proposed Milestone:

Bring 5 critical mineral/semiconductor plants online in the U.S. by 2027.

Ensure 90% domestic source or ally-sourced for chips and rare earths by 2028.

Cut average supply-chain delay for key components by 30% by 2028.

Question 6: Which of these goals feels most aligned with your vision—plant count, sourcing ratio, or supply delay?
